# PortaPDF

Small app that allows you to encrypt PDFs without needing to submit them to a webservice or pay some form of subscription fee.

This project would not be possible without [PikePDF](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf) and no modifications have been made to the source code.

Built using Python 3.9 within venv on Windows and encrypted using PyInstaller to compile to a single exe.

## TODO 

- Run and build instructions
- Test cases
- Additional functionality:

    - PDF Stitching
